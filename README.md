## Application Overview- 

Our applicationÂ builds a random crossword puzzle.Each level has four distinct phrases and has 4 buttons to do the functions of the app.

Firstly, we create a folder in our system and named it is puzzle. Now we have opened the vs code and opened this puzzle folder and we click a command to create the react native application with th  name of CrosswordPuzzle.
The command is :
```
npx create-expo-app CrosswordPuzzle
```

To move into the directory of project anc do the coding, click ``` cd CrosswordPuzzle ``` where cd stands for change directory.

Now, to design our app and how it has to look we need app.js which is there in vs code on left side . We need CrosswordGrid.js to define how our puzzlesin the app looks like,So we have to create a file CrosswordGrid.js.

The app. js code and CrosswordGrid.js screenshots in vs code -
